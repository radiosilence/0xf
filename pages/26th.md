# Some Facts About March for the Alternative - 26/03/2011

As you may know, the media coverage of the "March for the Alternative" on the 26th of May were grossly distorted and at times completely incorrect. This, in combination with the irritating but expected rhetoric from right-wingers prompted me to give my side of the story. Unlike pretty much everyone judging the protests, I was actually there, so I saw what happened with my own eyes, and can make my own judgements as opposed to reading the news and smugly lording over everyone.

The MET officially said we were allowed to occupy Trafalgar Square as it is a public space. People happily partied and danced to samba for ages and were completely non-violent.

I have lots of bruises and a bit of a limp, but I'm ok. At the "Battle of Trafalgar" I managed to push a couple of officers quite a way back before I realised I was quite far behind police lines, so returned to the crowd. They tried to throttle me with the bandana around my neck so I took it off. We were trying to be non violent, we just wanted them to leave us alone to have our party. It was the police that were lashing out with batons, shields and kicks. They really get stuck in, I think the kicking is the worst, but batons aren't so bad if you deflect the things. It was difficult as most of us were shouting for people to stop throwing bottles, but the police were idiotic to think that wading in and ruining the party wouldn't cause people to kick off. It was quite clear they just wanted to get rid of us, DESPITE the statement the MET issued that we would be allowed to occupy Trafalgar.

 At the occupation of Fortnums -- the vast majority of people there were just being civilly disobedient to make a point -- some stuff got knocked over when people were getting in, but as people settled down, protesters went around tidying up the shop and putting boxes back on shelves. It was a very respectful atmosphere, mixed with anger and chanting. The guys outside tagging the windows were completely unconnected with UKUncut -- I think most were black bloc and had climbed up from outside or something.

My girlfriend and I *just* missed the clashes in Leicester Square. We left Fortnums at one of the small opportunities they actually gave us, and managed to get past the side of the police lines and get into a shop before the violence. The people who were still in Fortnums after we left got arrested for ``Aggravated Trespassing''. The police really messed up at that point, wading in and getting stuck between two angry groups of protesters, which kicked off and led to the police having to run away. That said, generally speaking the police were friendly and well mannered. One we were talking to earlier even said "look, if you're going to do anything wrong, just don't get caught". Heh.

All in all, an exciting day. People have varied views about the effectiveness of different action, but I think civil disobedience makes an important point. Most of the police were nice, most of the protesters were nice, but there were a few bad eggs on either side. I think the most surreal and interesting thing was talking to the riot cops about music and things one second, then pushing against them and fending off blows, then talking again. It was weirdly respectful. I defend myself against the police, but needless violence is just that -- needless, and undermines the cause. An interesting video [March for the Alternative: behind police lines](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2011/mar/28/march-alternative-police-video) demonstrating that the TSG are told they can kick the shit out of people if they want. They are *not* ordered to. So any police officer who is kicking, striking, or smashing a protester with a shield is doing it on their own conscience. This is very important. The video also shows that the police just people, even if they are in denial about the effect cuts are having on them.

We *have* to stay together in solidarity with one another. **We may not agree with every action that another group does or every idea another person has, but we're all fighting for the same thing, and we can't let the media tear us apart.**

Some clarifications: 

  * Reports of firebombs are utter utter bullshit.
  * It was completely peaceful until the riot guys came and and started bludgeoning people.
  * When we quite rightly refused to leave they marched forward and lashed out with their batons.
  * The option to leave was not clear for ages and by that time it was not an option.
  * When they were not storming forward, we had fairly civil chats, but we made it clear that we had no intention of leaving.
  * They cited graffiti (was there earlier) and violence (there was no violence at Trafalgar until the police started pushing us around) as the reasons which we should leave.
  * As we were let out, one by one, we were photographed by FIT (forced to remove hats, scarfs, etc), and arrested us for ``Breach of the Peace''.
  * If people were kicking up a fuss, they were taken to the station and booked.
  * If we were polite, they drove us around for a while and ditched us in some random part of London with no regards to the fact that we had no idea where we were, many had no money or transport, and we were split up   from friends (and by this time our phones had run out of juice), so it was pretty fucked, as I had to limp around fucking Vauxhall and find a bus station.
  * During the day, the police were pretty ok, let people out and things, but what happened Trafalgar Square was utterly fucked up. They instigated the violence by charging into crowds of peaceful protesters with batons drawn, they started pushing a large crowd around for fuck all reason, of course people are going to react violently. I didn't see any attacks on the olympic clock, which was their excuse for going in. It was quite clear that they didn't want us there in the first place and were willing to resort to violent measures in order to remove us.
  * The press reported that they moved in because someone vandalised the Olympic Clock. This vandalism, you ask? A sticker. A *sticker*. Some other reasons that were given by press/police:

    * Graffiti
    * Fire (it was tiny)
    * Bottles being thrown (untrue!)
    * Trying to arrest a guy
  
    All valid illegalities but not really justification for marching in and beating everyone up.

  * Almost all ``Black bloc'' anarchists were **long gone** when we were at the statue. This is obvious, because they aren't going to stick around and get arrested as they would get into deeper shit than us. The people at the statue were just peaceful party goers who disagreed with the idea that we should move and disperse purely because the police told us to.
  * Peaceful protesters inside Fortnum &amp; Masons were told they were being held for their safety and would be allowed to leave freely. When they exited the store, they were arrested for "aggravated trespass", along with legal observers and journalists.
  * Inside Fortnum &amp; Masons, shoppers and staff were allowed to go about their business, and protesters moved out of their way to enable them to browse.

Some media: 

Here's some video I took inside Fortnums. It's pretty crap quality, but you can see clearly that nobody is smashing anything, everyone's standing around peacefully:

The last one is of Nelson's Column, Trafalgar square. It was night so I had to tweak the brightness, hence high levels of noise.
